I am a second-year student at the University of California, San Diego (though planning to graduate in 2024). I am a pure math major who dabbles in machine learning. You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/Ergodice/Ergodice.github.io/blob/e4bc7625ba00896f8b1d22f5b6e9ea4521d9faae/resume.pdf). 

My e-mail is d + *my surname* + @ucsd.edu.

## Course History

Detailed  course descriptions can be found at the [UCSD course catalog](catalog.ucsd.edu). Courses numbered in the 200s are graduate-level courses, while those in the 100s are upper-division undergraduate courses.

### 2022-2023 (UCSD, second year)

| Fall   | Winter    | Spring |
|---| ---| ---|
|MATH 200A <br> MATH 220A <br> MATH 240A <br> CSE 250A <br> POLI 27 | TBD  |  TBD |

I stopped taking undergraduate math classes my second year since while their material was interesting I did not feel too challenged by them. The graduate courses feel like a better fit for me.

### 2021-2022 (UCSD, first year)

I had originally intended to be a cognitive science major but decided that it wasn't for me. Things worked out well in the end since the cognitive science courses I took can be used to satisfy graduation requirements, as can the philosophy courses. I have copied the course descriptions for your convenience.
